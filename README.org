* My dwm build

I forked this from Luke Smith's dwm fork and I am pretty sure it was based on 6.1-ish. I plan on rebasing it on suckless' master, but seeing the amount of patching I have done, I should do that sooner than later.

I applied / hacked some patches:

- full gaps (ru-gaps)
- bottom stack
- centered master (ru-gaps version)
- systray in statusbar ( hacked with padding, no transparency though )
- transparency in status bar (need to hack systray to have transparency, but that is harder than it looks...)
- noborder
- movestack
- xrdb
- notitle
