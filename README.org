* My dwm build

I forked ot from Luke Smith's dwm fork and I am pretty sure it was based on 6.1-ish.

I applied / hacked some patches:

- full gaps
- bottom stack
- centered master (edited to have gaps)
- status bar ( hacked with padding, no transparency though )
- transparency in status bar
- noborder
- movestack

I removed the drawing of the current window title in the status bar.
